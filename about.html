        <section id="aboutMe"></section>
       <p>I am 23 years old. My life hasn’t even started yet according to everyone around me, yet I feel like an old man who’s been running in circles for centuries. Music is the love of my life. We have a…complicated relationship. Music has taught me how to love, how to articulate my emotions, how to find the real passionate people in any field, but it hasn’t brought me “success”. After 8 years of doing something without any real change in result any smart person would find a new path. “Maybe you should teach” they all say; “You’d be a great coach or writer or therapist, guru, politician, etc…”. They just don’t get it. Sometimes I feel crazy, lost, alone you name it I’ve felt it. But one thing has always been true, music loves me more than anyone will ever understand. When I was alone and lost in the world, music saved me. When I was looking for purpose and meaning in this life, music made me. When I was arrogant and in need of guidance, music shaped me. If I didn’t make music I would not be even a fraction of the man I am today. It is the songs that traveled from Ireland(U2), and Gary Indiana(MJ), and LA(the rest of 'em) that spoke to my struggles when no one would listen. It’s the out of body experiences that kept me going when my only audience was the walls around me. I am 23 years old but I’ve lived a hundred lives in this music. Finding new sounds, meeting new people I wouldn’t have met otherwise, helping people in ways I never imagined or even intended. Music is powerful beyond power, and can change the world around us on a subconscious level. My music is who I am. My name is Sean Kenneally and I make music.</p>
